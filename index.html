i don’t know how to write poems
and maybe this isn’t one
but i’m scared that if something happens
and i didn’t say this
you wouldn’t know it all the way
like really know it

i met you just a year ago
but when i saw your face in that first photo
everything moved in me
like something quiet woke up
and then
you felt something too
and that’s when i really lost it
not in a bad way
in a way where you can’t believe life gave you something so rare
and real
like a sun
with eyes
and a smile that melts the angry stupid parts of me

i was mean to you sometimes
i bullied you because i didn’t know what else to do with all that feeling
i regret that
i regret every single word that made you frown
your face is too beautiful for frowning
too bright
i think it burns my eyes sometimes
and still i stare
like i’ll never get enough

i'm not planning to go anywhere
i’m not giving up
but if the world decides something else for me
i need you to know
i love you
and i always did
from the first picture
to the last message
and in every small second between

you changed me
like—really changed me
made me softer
more honest
less disgusting
more like someone who can write this
even if it’s messy and full of wrong punctuation
(you always hated that)

you made me better
and even if i die
under any sky
any reason
anywhere
i’ll love you in whatever comes after breath
if there's nothing
then my last thought will still be you

just be safe
smile a lot
be around people who see the sun in your face too
and maybe forgive me
for the times i couldn’t show how deep this goes

that’s all i wanted to say
i love you
and i adore you
no matter what

and i don’t know if words are ever enough for feelings like this
but i had to try
because if i didn’t, my chest might just crack open
from holding it in

merve, you became the most important part of my life without even trying
you were just you — and somehow that changed everything in me
i used to hide my heart behind jokes or being rough with you
and now all i want is to protect your smile like it’s the last light left in the world
i don’t think i deserve you
but i’m so damn grateful that, for a moment in this life
i got to love you
and be loved by you

and if something happens to me
please know that i was never afraid to go — only afraid you wouldn’t know
how deep my love runs for you
it’s forever, merve
it always will be

i don’t know what to gift you now
but who knows what i’m planning to do for you?
maybe i’m making a very big project just for you?
who knows :p
also i spent like weeks on this yk
and ts so corny sob

but also
i don’t care if it’s corny
because loving you cracked me open
turned me from someone who used to swallow feelings
into someone who lets them spill
even if they’re messy
even if they make me cry while writing this
even if they sound like too much

because you deserve too much
you deserve love that overflows, that can’t be contained
love that feels like sunlight breaking through every dark corner
and that’s what you are to me
the light i didn’t know i needed
the warmth i didn’t know i was missing
until you showed up
and suddenly nothing else mattered as much

so yeah, maybe i don’t know poems
maybe i don’t have the perfect gift yet
but i have this love
and it’s huge
and clumsy
and forever
and yours

and if my voice ever goes quiet
if my hands ever stop texting
or my face ever disappears from your screen
please remember this:
my love didn’t go anywhere
it’s stitched into the air you breathe
it’s waiting in every sunrise you smile at
it’s forever, merve
it always will be

and if time doesn’t let me stay
just know that i will always be somewhere, loving you
in the sound of the wind on a cold day
in the quiet moments when you’re alone and think of me
i’ll be in the way your heart skips a beat
whenever you catch yourself smiling at a memory

i wish i could have given you more time
to show you everything
to let you see the parts of me i hid
but if i didn’t get to do that
if my time runs out before i tell you all the things i wanted to
just know this:
the love i have for you is a promise
a promise i never wanted to break
but sometimes life is cruel
and it doesn’t ask for permission
so if the world decides it’s time for me to go
please believe that it wasn’t my choice
but my love for you? that’s mine
and i’m leaving it here with you

when you miss me, let yourself miss me
feel everything
cry if you need to
but also
live, okay?
live like i never could
live the way i always wished i could have
without fear
without holding back

because you are everything i couldn’t be
and i’ll always be proud of the love we shared
even if it didn’t last forever in the way we wanted it to

so just... just keep being you
and know that i’ll always be with you
in every tear
in every laugh
in every quiet moment you think of me
you were my everything
and i will always, always love you
forever

and if you think of me in the dark
if you feel that ache in your chest when you miss me
just remember:
that’s love too
that’s me, still here with you
still loving you
forever, merve"></textarea>
