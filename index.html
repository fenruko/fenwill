i don’t know how to write poems
and maybe this isn’t one
but i’m scared that if something happens
and i didn’t say this
you wouldn’t know it all the way
like really know it

i met you just a year ago
but when i saw your face in that first photo
everything moved in me
like something quiet woke up
and then
you felt something too
and that’s when i really lost it
not in a bad way
in a way where you can’t believe life gave you something so rare
and real
like a sun
with eyes
and a smile that melts the angry stupid parts of me

i was mean to you sometimes
i bullied you because i didn’t know what else to do with all that feeling
i regret that
i regret every single word that made you frown
your face is too beautiful for frowning
too bright
i think it burns my eyes sometimes
and still i stare
like i’ll never get enough

i'm not planning to go anywhere
i’m not giving up
but if the world decides something else for me
i need you to know
i love you
and i always did
from the first picture
to the last message
and in every small second between

you changed me
like—really changed me
made me softer
more honest
less disgusting
more like someone who can write this
even if it’s messy and full of wrong punctuation
(you always hated that)

you made me better
and even if i die
under any sky
any reason
anywhere
i’ll love you in whatever comes after breath
if there's nothing
then my last thought will still be you

just be safe
smile a lot
be around people who see the sun in your face too
and maybe forgive me
for the times i couldn’t show how deep this goes

that’s all i wanted to say
i love you
and i adore you
no matter what
I don’t know if words are ever enough for feelings like this, but I had to try. Merve, you became the most important part of my life without even trying. You were just you — and somehow that changed everything in me. I used to hide my heart behind jokes or being rough with you, and now all I want is to protect your smile like it’s the last light left in the world. I don’t think I deserve you, but I’m so damn grateful that, for a moment in this life, I got to love you and be loved by you. If something happens to me, please know that I was never afraid to go — only afraid you wouldn’t know how deep my love runs for you. It’s forever, Merve. It always will be.
            i dont know what to gift you now, but who knows what im planning to do for you? maybe im making a very big project just for you? who knows :p also i spent like weeks on this yk and ts so corny sob"></textarea>
